These are Inspircd configuration files for quick-to-use chat.

The IRC Client shown is "QUASSEL IRC"

Note: I must clarify that this configuration is specifically based on using your PC as a server but there is no problem using (server as such).


## Installation and configuration

#### Dependencies 

* Inspircd
* Ubuntu *Optional
* IRC Client (Quassel IRC)

Well, to install **Inspircd** on your machine, read the official documentation since it will give you more information there, depending on what operating system you have.
[Inspircd Documentation](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/installation/) 



Having *Inspircd* installed. Clone this repository and copy the ***inspircd.conf*** file to your installation folder.

**REMEMBER, MAKE THE CHANGES ACCORDING TO YOUR NEEDS IN THE** *inspircd.conf* **FILE**

Assuming you are on Linux the path is:

```bash
cd /etc/inspircd/
```
Now start the service.

```bash
inspircd 
```

And that's it, you would have Inspircd running on your system. Now you can connect with your favorite IRC client
